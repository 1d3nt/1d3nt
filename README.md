# Hi, I'm Sam (aka ident) 👋

Ever since I can remember, I’ve gone by the handle **ident**. My journey with programming began back in 1999 on the old MSN chat network. I stumbled upon the fascinating world of bots when I saw someone get banned and instantly return to a channel—curiosity piqued, I dove in! That led me to create my first website as a kid, and believe it or not, it’s still up! Check it out for a trip down memory lane: [MSN Bot World](https://www.geocities.ws/myths_bot_world/MSNBOTPAGE.html).

### A Love for VB.NET & Low-Level Magic ✨
VB.NET isn’t just my main language—it’s been a lifeline through tough times, and I’m proud to call it my home base. I love diving into the nitty-gritty of **website manipulation** with HTTP requests, and I have an unusual fascination with **processes**, **tokens**, and **P/Invoke**. Yep, I know—it’s weird, but it’s my happy place! 😄

### Explore My Work 🌍
I love building and tinkering with all sorts of projects. Want to see what I’ve been up to? Likely not much, as I’ve only just felt confident enough to publish my work! 😅 But I promise it will grow! Head over to my website or follow my links below:
