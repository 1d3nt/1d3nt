# Hi, I'm Sam (aka ident) 👋

Ever since I can remember, I’ve gone by the handle **ident**. For a while, I also went by Nicon, Lord_Nicon after my favourite movie *Hackers* (1995), though I spelt it wrong—not on purpose, lol. My journey with programming began back in 1999 on the old MSN chat network. I stumbled upon the fascinating world of bots when I saw someone get banned and instantly return to a channel—curiosity piqued, I dove in! That led me to create my first website as a kid, and believe it or not, it’s still up! Check it out for a trip down memory lane: [MSN Bot World](https://www.geocities.ws/myths_bot_world/MSNBOTPAGE.html).

When I'm not coding or getting lost in HTTP requests and P/Invoke, I'm spending time with my amazing partner, who has always supported me on this journey. They're the reason I’m able to keep pushing forward, and I couldn’t do it without them!

### A Love for VB.NET & Low-Level Magic ✨
VB.NET isn’t just my main language—it’s been a lifeline through tough times, and I’m proud to call it my home base. I love diving into the nitty-gritty of **website manipulation** with HTTP requests, and I have an unusual fascination with **processes**, **tokens**, and **P/Invoke**. Yep, I know—it’s weird, but it’s my happy place! 😄

⚠️ Disclaimer: You'll notice that all my repositories have both a main and master branch. The master branch is the stable version, while the main branch will always have the latest updates, though they might still be a bit rough around the edges. If you're looking for the most polished version, stick with master; if you want the newest features, main is where you'll find them!

Also, just a heads-up: I sometimes run into issues with GPG signing, so there may be quirks related to that.
